# A predictive DASH QoE approach based on machine learning at Multi-Access Edge Computing 
# Abstract
Network operators expected to run on with fast-growing multimedia video streaming (e.g., DASH) traffic demand while providing a high Quality of Experience (QoE) to the end-users. The cost, complexity, and scalability of existing QoE estimation solutions have significant limitations to infer QoE from network traffic. However, this works provides an end-user QoE estimation method based on a predictive passive QoE probe mechanism of DASH mobile video using a Machine Learning (ML) approach running at network edge nodes. We describe the design and implementation of probe configuration at the target edge, with traffic flow monitoring to generate network-level Quality of Service (QoS) metrics. Moreover, build a QoS-QoE correlation ML model in realtime fashion for detecting patterns of the user equipment traffic behavior to predict user QoE.
