Reproducibility in research, specifically in computational research, is getting a lot of momentum
these days. The diversity of standards and tools relating to reproducible research is vast and quite impossible to portray in as single. However, when it comes to individual works, the term and concept of
best practices could help correlate with typically reproducible research key elements and basic rules.
The best practices dictate the recommended course of action, more specifically, what one should need
to do or not to do for both while preparing any work for reproducible and reproduce any original work.
The motive of this best practice documentation to share my experience in the context of reproducible
research-related tools utilities while making this work. The observation will be in the formate of do’s
and don’t’s of the reproducible research-related tools associated with code development, data handling,
documentation, workflow, and distribution key elements
The observation will be illustrated as the following orders:


## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
